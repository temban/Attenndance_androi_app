## Automatic Bluetooth Attendance

Marking attendance in schools/colleges are still done on physical registers which is time consuming and takes a lot of time to manually copy data from the register to a excel sheet. This process also makes getting personalized data like individual attendance percentage impossible.

Simplify aims to make this process simpler and with minimal physical work. Following are the features-
* Import Student details directly from excel sheets
* Export detailed student to excel sheet for the whole date range or by selecting date range
* Choose to manually mark students or scans students using Bluetooth (Using the MAC id's for each student)
* View indivdual student data like attendance percentage and days of absence/presence
* Graphically compare attendance percentage of each student
* Use of [Realm](https://realm.io/ "Realm") Database and [Scand Database Browser](http://scand.com/products/realmbrowser/ "Scand") to edit the RAW database

  * The columns are respectively **Roll Number (Primary Key)** , **Name** , **Phone Number** , **MAC ID 1** , **MAC ID 2** (For Bluetooth Attendance)
  * Two students **CANNOT** have the same RollNumber for the whole app, since Students are put in the same table, not different table for each class.
  * If you don't want MAC ID's, please fill both the columns with random data rather than keeping it empty

* The exported Excel sheet has the following format -
